            <h2>Why Olhão ?</h2>
            <h3>The Shellfish Capital</h3>
            <p>
              The municipal markets of Olhão, one of the ex-libris of the town
              of Olhão, began to be built in 1912 and were inaugurated four
              years later. For nearly a century, they have been one of the
              illustrated postcards of Olhão and a must for tourists and
              residents.
            </p>
            <p>
              The historic quarter is one of the most important places to be
              seen and visited in Olhão because of its typicity and history. The
              cubist architecture is unique in the country.

                <p>
                  It is a really cosy place with a good vibe. The meals are very
                  colourful and more importantly, delicious! It is great for
                  meat eaters but also for vegan eaters. I just love it.

            <p>
              Hi! My name is Lindsay and I've been visiting Olhão in October
              2023 with my mother and sister. I thought the village and the
              islands were really beautiful. I created this page as part of a
              project for SheCodes Responsive to develop my coding skills.
